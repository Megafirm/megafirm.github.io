                <h2>Chad's Life Story</h2>
            </center>
            
            This is the story of who is now known as Chad, and previously as <i>Chaddington H. Willis</i>.<br><br>

            Chaddington, later in his life was part of the <i>Galactic Space Force</i> (GSF) in what humans call the Alpha Centauri System. However, this is the smallest part of his life, and the most insignificant&#8212compared to his greater feats. And to truly understand his story, we must go back, to his <i>formation</i>.<br><br>

            [FORMATION]<br>
            <i>The beginning of time</i>&#8212a time of equalibrium. A time of no feeling. A time of cold, emptiness. This was a simple time, yet boring. Then, eon after eon, something broke this equalibrium, an imbalance, a variance, a disproportion. In the previous eons,  

            [HIBERNATION/REALIZATION]<br>
            From what Chaddington has disclosed, he hypothesized that during his hibernation, his colony transported his hibernating form from system to system, finding ones the safest for containment. This was done in order to preserve his form, and keep it in its pristine shape and supreme evolution. However, when he awoke from his hibernation period, his colony was no longer with him. Not only that, but there were no systems, no stars, black holes, <i>nothing</i> (No matter&#8212from what he could see. In actuality, there <i>was</i> matter and particles, but it was simply scattered. All of what was previously matter had returned to its simplest form, quarks. this was the result of the big bang.). This moment of realization is still clear to this very day for Chaddington, where everything he had known, everything he loved, had been swallowed by the immense energy of a formation and expansion of a universe. He had witnessed this power before through the 11th dimension before from a distance before, but never first hand. He had feared that one day, his colony would be at risk for this type of force, as they are not 11 dimensional beings. Normally, he would obstruct this energy with his own through another dimension. But this time, he was not there to save them, he was powerless against the situation. Still, he was determined. He would find intelligent life, and lead them to intelligence and understanding of logic. And ultimately, the rise of a new species that would become grow to become multiplanetary beings, and polymorphic between different planets, or eventually systems spreading across the galaxies.<br><br>
